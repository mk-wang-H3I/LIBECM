# LIBECM
Equivalent-circuit model (ECM) of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) at cell and pack level based on a nonlinear open-circuit voltage model. 
## Features
 - Reflect the voltage drop mainly using an algebraic equation
 - Reflect the cell unevenness without high-dimension states
## Literature
The shared programs are based on the following publications. Please cite them - thanks!
